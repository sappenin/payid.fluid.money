This repository hosts the web content for the site [https://fluid.money](https://fluid.money), which is a demo site 
 to illustrate how a single domain hosted solely on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can become [PayID-enabled](https://payid.org/)  
(in other words, the simplest, easiest, least amount of work way to enable PayID).
